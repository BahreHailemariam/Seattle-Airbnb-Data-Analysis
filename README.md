# 🏠 Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis
## 📌 Problem Statement

Seattle’s short-term rental market through Airbnb has expanded rapidly, providing travelers with diverse accommodation options and hosts with business opportunities. However, stakeholders face several challenges:

Here are key insights based on the Seattle Airbnb dashboard
1. Overall Market Performance

- **Average Daily Rate (ADR): $120** → Reasonable compared to hotel alternatives in Seattle.

- **Occupancy Rate: 75%** → Indicates strong demand, with most listings booked regularly.

- **Revenue Per Available Listing (RevPAL): $65** → Healthy revenue flow, though optimization is possible.

- **Listings: ~4,700** → High supply across Seattle, suggesting a competitive market.

2. Neighborhood Insights

- Some **neighborhoods significantly outperform others** in revenue, shown by darker zones on the map.

- Central areas (closer to downtown & attractions) **show higher ADR and occupancy**, making them prime investment zones.

- Outlying neighborhoods have lower revenue potential, possibly due to distance from tourist hubs.

3. Seasonality & Demand

- **Occupancy and revenue peak in summer months (May–August)** → driven by tourism season.

- **Winter months show dips** → hosts may need to reduce prices or offer discounts to maintain occupancy.

Dynamic pricing strategies can maximize revenue during peak while minimizing vacancy in off-peak.

4. Host Performance

- **Superhosts outperform non-Superhosts** in both revenue and occupancy.

- Non-Superhosts earn less, highlighting the importance of gaining Superhost status (higher trust & visibility).

- Multi-listing hosts likely benefit from economies of scale, but saturation could affect margins.

5. Amenities Impact

- **Wi-Fi has the strongest link to higher occupancy** (almost essential for bookings).

- **Parking and kitchen availability** also contribute positively, though less than Wi-Fi.

- Hosts without these amenities are at a disadvantage compared to competitors.

6. Market Saturation

- Some **neighborhoods are oversupplied** with listings but don’t show strong occupancy (shown by larger bubbles).

- **Growth opportunities exist in underserved areas** with lower density but higher demand.

- Investors should avoid oversaturated markets and focus on emerging, high-demand zones.
